[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/emersion/go-smtp.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/emersion/go-smtp)

An ESMTP client and server library written in Go.

## Features

* ESMTP client & server implementing [RFC 5321]
* Support for additional SMTP extensions such as [AUTH] and [PIPELINING]
* UTF-8 support for subject and message
* [LMTP] support

## Relationship with net/smtp

The Go standard library provides a SMTP client implementation in `net/smtp`.
However `net/smtp` is frozen: it's not getting any new features. go-smtp
provides a server implementation and a number of client improvements.
